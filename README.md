Want to hear my thought process on this project here is a short video I made https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jHfh_mb-5EggMrYQUKStwxhxSfmLq1cj/view?usp=sharing

This is the third project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on a Figma Design.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Flexgrid
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform
- Responsive design

## Plan on improving the project

Adding Javascript to the project to add functionality to function as an actual socail media platform.
