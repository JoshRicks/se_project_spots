https://joshricks.github.io/se_project_spots/

Want to hear my thought process on this project here is a short video I made https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jHfh_mb-5EggMrYQUKStwxhxSfmLq1cj/view?usp=sharing

This is the third project of the Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on a Figma Design.

In the forth project I added modals to this project creating the modals with HTML and styled in CSS as well as adding basic Javascript to make the modals open and close.

In the fifth project I converted the cards into a template embracing what I learned about the DOM and made the modals completely functional with Javascript adding new cards on form submition and the ability to update the profile.

In the sixth project I added form validation with Javascript adding to the userfriendly nature of the modal forms.

In the 9th I integrated NPM Webpack and did some finishing touches on the Javascript the website is now fully funcional.
